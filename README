This keylogger was built purely as a learning experience and I am not responsible for any possible misuse. And I feel
I should warn you, using this to spy on people is illegal, and could get you in a lot of trouble so don't do it!

compiled with dev c++ just fine.

The keylogger works by using windows hooks to capture keyboard input.
It then outputs this to two files, a unicode + special chars file, and a Virtual_Key file
which stores the virtual key codes. 

This logger moves itself to system32 and adds a registry key to make it run on startup. This behaviour should
be caught by any sensible antivirus and identified as spyware and rightfully so.

This logger does nothing to transmit the recorded key strokes. The inclusion of such additional features would be pretty 
irresponsible and could lead to nefarious uses, and I won't be responsible for such uses.

PLEASE USE RESPONSIBLY!!!!
